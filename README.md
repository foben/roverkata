# Mars Rover Kata

A simplified version of the Mars Rover Kata.
The Api is implemented in rover.py. 

All tests are found in the tests.py module.
The tests.py file can be run directly, but for a more verbose result running

```python -m unittest -v tests```

is recommended.

Running rover_ui.py starts a visual representation right on the shell.
It allows creation of custom-sized grids and movement of the 'rover' along the grid.
after setup, give one or more movement commands, seperated by commas:
f: forward
b: backward
l: turn left
r: turn right
